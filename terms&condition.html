      <p>Kreative karma (“Kreative karma”) takes the issue of protecting your privacy very seriously and is well aware that you are concerned about the way in which collected personal information is used and shared. We appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice (namely, this “Privacy Policy”) describes how we may collect personal information about you, how we may use it, what choices you have regarding it, and how we protect it. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is a part of the Terms of Use of this Kreative karma Web site (Facebook App or the “Site”) and we encourage you to become familiar with the terms and conditions contained herein.
